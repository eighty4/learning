# Flutter animation along a custom path

Uses [Path.computeMetrics](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Path/computeMetrics.html)
and [PathMetric.getTangentForOffset](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/PathMetric/getTangentForOffset.html)
to calculate an animated position with the animation controller's progress value translated to the length of the path.

See [ButtonState.calcOffset](https://github.com/eighty4/learning/blob/main/flutter/contour-animation/lib/main.dart#L126)
for the animated position calculation.

```
flutter run
```

ðŸ“Œ I could not get animation progress to be tracked on a timing curve (easeIn, bounceOut, etc.) when customizing
an animation in this fashion. The animation controller's listener always fires in linear intervals.

ðŸ“Œ Running this sample on macos and triggering the animation with a tap immediately after alt tabbing away from and back
to the app will cause the animation to skip renders until after the animation completes.
